Information and Suggestions
- You should keep your sms country (docs.5sim.net/#countries-list) and account country the same to limit "post paid phone number" error
- Account usernames have to be between 6-12 chars
- Without proxies you can only make 4 accounts per 30m - 1h on home ip
- Less detected proxies = easier captchas
